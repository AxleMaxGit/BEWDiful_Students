General Assembly Back End Web Dev Course Blog


Blog for Session 1

I am excited to learn how to create web apps by doing this course. The course has started well and the instructor is easy to understand and explains things well. 

I have an idea for a web app that to help childcare workers create development portfolios for their students using software rather than physical scrap books. 

First course was an intro into the Command Line and Git. This first session was a great session and I really enjoyed getting into the content - I am really looking forward to the next lesson. 

I like that there is so much hands on work to do and basically no theory. I wish I had done this type of learning as well as this course 10 years ago. 

Looking forward to the next class and to getting into some Ruby code as well as the Rails framework.
