Day one

A quick glance around the room shows that i'm the only with a beard and wearing plaid. Does that give me some sort of geek advantage? Maybe. Or maybe i'm just another hipster urban lumberjack.

Ruby and Rails installation woes aside, i'm feel ready to completely git my entire computer, and can't wait to git all the subdirectories within.

Craig out.

ps. I'm already sick of committing and forgetting to add the -m flag, and consequently having to remember how to save and get out of the edit message screen. One day i'll get it.
